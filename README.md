# xwiki-TopicModelling-Prototype


This protoype is made according to the syntax given by the Xwiki for building Macros to develop a macro that will use Java Library MALLET to apply the concept of Topic Modelling on xwiki document to organize Knowledge.

This macro takes the page name as refrence to the document and fetch the content of that document using the API bridges.
Then, the content will get loaded into the Model for analysis and some topics will be given as output after Analysis.

This still have some Errors, and i have made another branch named Delayed so that i can push the further updates without disturbing the work done before Deadline.
